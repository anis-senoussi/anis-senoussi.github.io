									<h2>Research</h2>
									<p>
										I am currently designing out-of-equilibrium in vitro systems to study biologically-inspired mechanisms of pattern formation and gene expression. In particular, I reconstitute cytoskeletal proteins, nucleic acids and enzymes and build artificial chemical reaction networks and systems that self-organize in space and time with a goal to provide insights on how to engineer materials that emulate properties of living systems.

										<h4>Active gels</h4>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-xsmall">
												<p>
													Because they intrinsically form out-of-equilibrium systems, molecules from living cells have been purified and reconstituted to build active systems that can convert chemical energy into large-scale motion. We study the patterning properties of an active gel composed of stabilized microtubules, clusters of kinesin motors, ATP and non-adsorbing polymers. It is possible to obtain many different patterns (asters, contractions or active flows) by changing only a few parameters. In particular, we have reecently described a novel type of pattern consisting in a 3D corrugated active nematic sheet of microtubules in which the wavelength and the dynamics can be precisely tuned <a class="hyperef_article" href="#article_02">[2]</a>.

										<h4>Programmable reaction-diffusion patterns in complex environments</h4>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-xsmall">
												<p>
													Molecular systems can self-organize when molecules are involved in chemical reactions and transported by diffusion. Using short single-stranded DNA and a few enzymes, we engineer synthetic biochemical systems based on nucleic acid hybridization reactions in which the reactivity is easily predicted by the Watson-Crick pairing rule coupled to enzymes (the <i>PEN-DNA toolbox</i>). Thus, autocatalytic reactions, bistable switches and oscillations have been created. They generate spatio-temporal patterns such as propagating fronts, stable bands and pulses. We study the structures that emerge when this programmable reaction-diffusion system is combined with other order-generating systems such as active gels.

										<h4>RNA regulators & cell-free transcription-translation</h4>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-xsmall">
												<p>
													We study de novo engineered gene regulators made of RNA. Upon binding to a second RNA, they change their secondary
													structure and influence the expression rate of a downstream gene. We showed that a reconstituted cell-free transcription-translation system composed of recombinant proteins (<i>PURE</i>) can be used to provide valuable information about the performances of in silico designed riboregulators <a class="hyperef_article" href="#article_01">[1]</a>.
